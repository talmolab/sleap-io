"""Data structure for the labels, a top-level container for pose data.

`Label`s contain `LabeledFrame`s, which in turn contain `Instance`s, which contain
`Point`s.

This structure also maintains metadata that is common across all child objects such as
`Track`s, `Video`s, `Skeleton`s and others.

It is intended to be the entrypoint for deserialization and main container that should
be used for serialization. It is designed to support both labeled data (used for
training models) and predictions (inference results).
